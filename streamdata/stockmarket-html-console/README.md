# streamdata-js/stockmarket-console

This sample application shows how to use the <a href="http://streamdata.io" target="_blank">streamdata.io</a> Javascript SDK.

The streamdata.io JavaScript SDK allows the use of streamdata.io to get data pushed from various sources and use them in your application.

Edit the `index.html` and replace:

`var token = "<YOUR STREAMDATAIO TOKEN>";`

with your streamdata.io token you can get at <a href="https://portal.streamdata.io/" target="_blank">streamdata.io portal</a>.

In a shell terminal, run the commands:

```
cd stockmarket-console
npm install
```

This will install the streamdata.io JavaScript SDK and a Json-Patch JavaScript library.

Then, to run the sample, open the `index.html` in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE > 10) and the web console of the developers tools of your browser.

**You should see data and patches printed in the console** (if the web console has not been open first, you may have missed the first data: in this case, refresh the page or open the web console before the `index.html`).

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to ask: <a href="mailto://support@streamdata.io">support@streamdata.io</a>

Enjoy!
